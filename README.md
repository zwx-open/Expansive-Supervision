**Abstract.** Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has achieved remarkable success in creating immersive media representations through its exceptional reconstruction capabilities. However, the computational demands of dense forward passes and volume rendering during training continue to challenge its real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Expansive Supervision to reduce time and memory costs during NeRF training from the
perspective of partial ray selection for supervision. Specifically, we observe that training errors exhibit a long-tail distribution
correlated with image content. Based on this observation, our
method selectively renders a small but crucial subset of pixels
and expands their values to estimate errors across the entire
area for each iteration. Compared to conventional supervision,
our approach effectively bypasses redundant rendering processes,
resulting in substantial reductions in both time and memory
consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating
Expansive Supervision within existing state-of-the-art acceleration frameworks achieves 52% memory savings and 16% time
savings while maintaining comparable visual quality

## Enviroment Setup
Tested Enviroments:
- Ubuntu 20.04 with PyTorch 1.12.1 & CUDA 11.3.1 on RTX 3090

## Run the Code
We have prepared configuration for runnning baselines with `lego` scenes in `nerf-syn` dataset.
Just uncomment corresponding functions in `run.py`:
```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_standard_nerf(use_cuda=0)
    # run_egra_nerf(use_cuda=1)
    # run_soft_nerf(use_cuda=2)
    # run_expansive_nerf(use_cuda=3)
```

If you want to run all scenes in one shot, please use `--multi_data` in args.

For more coinfiguration, please refer to `./opt.py` and `./components/tesorf/tensorf_opt.py`.
